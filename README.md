# Flight-Delay-Prediction


This project involves a comprehensive statistical analysis of the causes of airline delays using various models and techniques to derive insights and make data-driven decisions. We predict whether the flight delays .

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/therealmazin/Flight-Delay-Prediction
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Flight-Delay-Prediction
    ```
3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Flight_delay_prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Models Used
This project employs the following statistical models and techniques:

1. **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting the relationship between delay duration and potential causes.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Used for classification problems where the outcome is binary (e.g., whether a flight is delayed or not).
3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of delay causes.
4. **Chi-Square Test**: Used to test the independence of delay causes and other categorical variables.
5. **Time Series Analysis**: Used for analyzing time-ordered data points to understand underlying patterns and forecast future delays.
